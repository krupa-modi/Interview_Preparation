## 📌 What is `useContext`?

`useContext` is a **React Hook** used to access data from a **Context API** without passing props manually through every component.
It helps solve the problem of **Prop Drilling**.

---

# 🤔 What is Prop Drilling?

Suppose you have data in a parent component and need it in a deeply nested child component.

Without Context:

```jsx
App → Parent → Child → GrandChild
```

You pass props at every level even if intermediate components don't need them.

This is called:

# ❌ Prop Drilling

Example:

```jsx
<App user="Krupa" />
```

Then:

```jsx
<Parent user={user} />
<Child user={user} />
<GrandChild user={user} />
```

This becomes messy in large applications.

---

# ✅ Solution → Context API + useContext

React Context lets you share data globally.

Examples:

* Theme
* User Login Data
* Language
* Auth
* Dark Mode
* Cart Data

# 🧠 Simple Definition

> `useContext` allows a component to directly access data from a Context without prop drilling.

---

# 📦 Syntax

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext)
```

---

# ⚙️ Steps to Use `useContext`

There are 3 main steps:

---

# 1️⃣ Create Context

```jsx
const UserContext = createContext()
```

---

# 2️⃣ Provide Context

Wrap components with Provider.

```jsx
<UserContext.Provider value={data}>
```

---

# 3️⃣ Consume Context

Use `useContext`.

```jsx
const value = useContext(UserContext)
```

---

# 🔥 Full Example

# 📁 File Structure

```bash
src/
 ├── App.js
 ├── UserContext.js
 └── Profile.js
```

---

# 📄 UserContext.js

```jsx
import { createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext();

export default UserContext;
```

---

# 📄 App.js

```jsx
import UserContext from "./UserContext";
import Profile from "./Profile";

function App() {

  const user = "Krupa";

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Profile />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

# 📄 Profile.js

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

function Profile() {

  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <h1>Hello {user}</h1>
  );
}

export default Profile;
```

---

# ✅ Output

```bash
Hello Krupa
```

```bash
createContext()
       ↓
Provider gives value
       ↓
useContext receives value
```

---

# 🎯 Real World Example – Dark Mode

---

# 📄 ThemeContext.js

```jsx
import { createContext } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext();

export default ThemeContext;
```

---

# 📄 App.js

```jsx
import ThemeContext from "./ThemeContext";
import Home from "./Home";

function App() {

  const theme = "dark";

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <Home />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

# 📄 Home.js

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import ThemeContext from "./ThemeContext";

function Home() {

  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div>
      Current Theme: {theme}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

---

# 🔥 Using Object in Context

Context can store:

* String
* Number
* Array
* Object
* Function

Example:

```jsx
const user = {
  name: "Krupa",
  age: 22
}
```

Provider:

```jsx
<UserContext.Provider value={user}>
```

Consume:

```jsx
const user = useContext(UserContext)

console.log(user.name)
```

---

# 🔥 Passing Function Through Context

Very important interview concept.

---

# 📄 App.js

```jsx
import { createContext, useState } from "react";
import Child from "./Child";

export const CounterContext = createContext();

function App() {

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
      <Child />
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

# 📄 Child.js

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import { CounterContext } from "./App";

function Child() {

  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CounterContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Child;
```

---

# ✅ Output

```bash
0
[Increment]
```

Click:

```bash
1
2
3
```

# 🧠 Why useContext is Powerful?

Because it avoids:

* Prop Drilling
* Repeated Props
* Complex component passing

# 🚫 Common Mistakes

---

# ❌ Forgetting Provider

Wrong:

```jsx
const value = useContext(UserContext)
```

Without Provider.

This gives:

```bash
undefined
```

---

# ❌ Using Outside Component

Wrong:

```jsx
const value = useContext(UserContext)
```

Outside component.

Hooks only work inside components/custom hooks.

---

# ❌ Re-render Problem

Whenever context value changes,
ALL consuming components re-render.

This can affect performance.

---

# ⚡ How Context Works Internally

React stores context globally in memory.

Provider updates value →
React notifies all consumers →
Consumers re-render.

# 🆚 useContext vs Props

| Props                | useContext           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pass manually        | Access directly      |
| Good for small apps  | Good for global data |
| Causes prop drilling | Avoids prop drilling |

---

# 🆚 useContext vs Redux

| useContext        | Redux            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Small-medium apps | Large apps       |
| Simple            | Complex          |
| Built into React  | External library |
| Less boilerplate  | More boilerplate |

* ⚠️ Important Interview Points
* `useContext` is a Hook
* It works with Context API
* It avoids prop drilling
* Re-render happens when context changes
* Used for global/shared state

# 🔥 Most Asked Interview Questions

---

# 1️⃣ What problem does `useContext` solve?

Answer:

It solves prop drilling by allowing components to access shared data directly.

---

# 2️⃣ Difference between Context API and Redux?

Answer:

Context API is simpler and built into React.
Redux is better for large complex state management.

---

# 3️⃣ Can `useContext` replace Redux?

Answer:

For small-medium apps yes.
For very large apps Redux/Zustand may be better.

---

# 4️⃣ Does `useContext` improve performance?

Answer:

Not always.

When context updates, all consumers re-render.

---

# 5️⃣ Can multiple contexts be used?

Answer:

Yes.

Example:

```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider>
  <ThemeContext.Provider>
    <App />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
</AuthContext.Provider>
```

---

# 🔥 Multiple Context Example

```jsx
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
const user = useContext(UserContext);
```

---

# 📌 Best Practices

* Create separate context files
* Keep context small
* Avoid storing everything in one context
* Use custom hooks for cleaner code

Example:

```jsx
export const useUser = () => {
  return useContext(UserContext);
};
```

Usage:

```jsx
const user = useUser();
```

---

# 🔥 Advanced Interview Concept

## Context + useReducer

Used for global state management.

Example:

```jsx
const StoreContext = createContext();
```

Then:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

Very common in large React apps.

---

# 🧠 Easy Way to Remember

```bash
createContext → Provider → useContext
```

OR

```bash
Create → Provide → Consume
```

---

# ✅ Final Summary

`useContext` is a React Hook used with Context API to share data globally between components without prop drilling.

It is commonly used for:

* Authentication
* Theme
* Language
* Cart
* User Data
* Global State

Main flow:

```bash
createContext()
   ↓
Provider
   ↓
useContext()
```

* Redux and Context API can be used together in the same React application. Redux is generally used for complex global state and server data management, while Context API is suitable for lightweight UI-related states such as themes, language preferences, or sidebar visibility. Using both appropriately helps keep the application scalable and maintainable.
